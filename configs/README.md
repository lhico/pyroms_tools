Copy the following files as:

_template_grid_config_esmf.py to grid_config_esmf.py

_template_grid_config_pyroms.py to grid_config_pyroms.py

_template_gridid.txt to gridid.txt

Now, insert your own experiments and grids to begin working with ROMS.

Note that, inside any config file, the absolute path are relative to the container's folder structure. So it works indepently of the computer which is running.
